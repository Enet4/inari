# Contributing

- Feel free to point out issues or raise questions through the issue tracker.
- Pull requests providing fixes or improvements are appreciated.
  Note that adding anything which is not a plain declaration of
  what is already in the Inari API is a non-goal.
  Your patience in handling the pull requests is appreciated,
  as this project will be low on my priority list.
